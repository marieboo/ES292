2M3.
Pr(Earth)=Pr(Mars)=0.5
Pr(Land-M)=1.0
Pr(Land-E)=0.3

Pr(Earth|land)=(0.5*0.3)/(0.5*0.3+0.5*1.0)=0.23
(Probability to see land on earth, divided by probability to land)

2H1. 
Assumption no other species, assumption gender equally distributed in both species
Pr(A)=Pr(B)=0.5
Pr(Twin-A)=0.1
Pr(Twin-B)=0.2

Probability it is twins the first time
Pr(Twin)=Pr(A)*Pr(Twin-A)+Pr(B)*Pr(Twin-B)=0.5*0.1+0.5*0.2=0.15=15%

Probability its Panda A or B
Pr(A|Twin)=(0.5*0.1)/(0.5*0.1+0.5*0.2)=1/3
Pr(B|Twin)=(0.5*0.2)/(0.5*0.1+0.5*0.2)=2/3

Probability it Twins from either Panda A or Panda B the second time
Pr(Twin2)=Pr(A|Twin)*Pr(Twin-A)+Pr(B|Twin)*Pr(Twin-B)=1/3*0.1+2/3*0.2=0.167=16.7%


Pr(Twin2|Twin)=Pr(Twin2,Twin)/Pr(Twin)=
